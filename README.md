# JOEListing – AEA JOE Job Ads Cleaning & Exploration
**Author:** Meifeng Yang  
**Last Updated:** November 26, 2025

This repository contains a Stata 18 pipeline for cleaning and exploring job
listings from the American Economic Association’s Job Openings for Economists
(JOE) platform. The script processes the downloaded Excel file, constructs
weekly job counts, groups listings by academic vs. non-academic categories, and
produces multiple visualizations.

---

## How to Run

1. Visit the JOE listings page:  
   https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings

2. Under **Download Options**, choose **Native XLS**.

3. Save the file in this folder as: joe_resultset_full_YYYYMMDD.xlsx


4. Open `script_clean_JOE.do` in Stata.

5. Update the `cd` path at the top of the script to match your machine.

6. Run the `.do` file from top to bottom.  
The script will:
- clean and filter US-based postings  
- flag academic vs. non-academic listings  
- convert posting dates to weekly time units  
- generate weekly job counts  
- export cleaned datasets  
- produce and save figures in the same folder  

---

## What the Script Demonstrates

- String handling & text cleanup  
- Date parsing and weekly conversion (`wofd()`, `%tw` labels)  
- Dynamic value-label construction  
- `contract` for aggregation  
- `reshape wide` for clustered bar plots  
- Stacked and side-by-side bar charts  
- Exporting PNG figures  

This project serves as a compact example of data wrangling and visualization
workflow in Stata.

## Repository Contents

- **script_clean_JOE.do**  
Main Stata pipeline that processes the downloaded Excel file and generates
all outputs below.

- **joe_resultset_non_academia_YYYYMMDD.xlsx / .dta**  
Cleaned dataset filtered to non-academic postings (generated by the script).

- **Figures** (auto-generated):
- `weekly_job_additions_overall.png`  
- `weekly_job_additions_broad_sections.png`  
- `weekly_job_additions_detailed_sections.png`

Each figure shows weekly posting activity, with increasing granularity from
overall counts → broad categories → detailed JOE sections.

## Final Note

This repo is intended as a clean example of Stata-based data processing,
visualization, and reproducible workflow.

**Good luck on the job market!**
